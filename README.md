# DERM-AI
We have built a web mobile application, 
that helps to renovate solutions to medical problems that dominate most people. 
Cancer has been one of the medical problems most people face. 
Most people die of cancer even without realizing they had one. 
So as Team Explore,  We have decided to specialize in cancer detection in the body of patients by getting clear image of their skin. 
The patient is expected to login to our app known as DermAI short for (Dermatologist AI). 
The app works by getting user details during registration, so as to have some bio info of them. 
Further more, it has a section where a user is able to upload an image of the part of the body he or she suspects might be cancerous. 
The app is made to work with a ML model that is able to predict if that part of the body is cancerous or not.
And it provides a solution and some medical tips to maintain the user health while he or she seeks for thorough medical check up.
We plan to diversify this project in such a way that it encompasses most medical problems that may exist through the use of highly sufisticated technologies and IOTs.
We also plan to detect some, if not many type of diseases that might exist in the body of a patient by getting the image or video of a drop of patience blood and the blood type of the person as well so as to aid the prediction.
All these can be made possible through the use of a highly accurately trained model.
